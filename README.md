# angular-docker-nest

This is a project built by following along [here](https://blog.logrocket.com/build-project-using-angular-nestjs/#prerequisites). 

I will containerize the application and have it use a DB instead of a json file after completing the project. Likely will use a NoSQL or Postgres.
